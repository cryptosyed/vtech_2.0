  <div class="container">
    <div class="About 1">
      <p>V-Tech Engineers which is proud company of Malenadu and Karnataka state hails from Kuntavalli village which
        comes under Melige gram panchayat of Thirthahalli taluk of Shivamogga district, the district popularly known as
        Cradle of Malenadu.

      </p>

    <div class="about 2">
      <h2 style="color: rgb(27, 27, 136);">The Glorious Journey From The Roots</h3>
        <p>In the region of malenadu, Farmers found their livelihood in the Arecanut crop. But as the years passed, the
          problems slowly started growing up and farmers who are completely depending on the crop got more bitter than
          sweet. At first, the problems faced by small and medium scale landowners/farmers was scarcity of labours for
          processing of Arecanut. Also adding to their woes was the fluctuation in the rates of Arecanut. These all
          slowly resulted in giving up mindset of farmers, since there was no appropriate rate for the crop grown. Young
          people who were witnessing this, started moving towards cities, from villages. This increased complications in
          the homes of the cultivators.

        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p> K. Vishwanath, who predominantly hails from agriculture family, carefully observed all these predicaments, he
        was determined to find full stop for the same and started working towards Arecanut dehusking machine right from
        the days of his studies in the year 2001-02. He received lot of criticism, obstacles in the initial stages of
        innovation. He was so tenacious that he didn’t look at anything other than his main motto of helping the farmers
        to overcome their problems. He worked round the clock to achieve his goal, visited cultivator’s home often to
        finetune his creation and finally delivered Arecanut dehusking machine which is of great quality and beneficial
        to farmers.</p>
      <p>Vishwanath, who had his interests in various domains, found purity of water of river Tunga [as said in puranas,
        Ganga snana, Tunga paana] is sky-high and with the intention of spreading the taste of the water across the
        country, established “Ibbani” which is pure water supplying Industry. It has its own fame and demand, popular
        across the state.</p>
      <p>V-Tech Engineers company, which got Accreditation from government of India in the year 2007, haven’t restricted
        themselves to Arecanut dehusking machine, but have spread their horizons by successfully inventing Arecanut
        bunch separator, Gorabalu polisher, Pepper separating machines and several more farmer-friendly and
        farmer-centric products.

        Numerous people have started their own business in the rural regions. For those kinds of people, getting
        imported equipment was only through some import companies in the big cities. Vishwanath, who will be travelling
        to foreign countries to buy the basic machineries for his company, scrutinized the circumstances and brought in
        the machineries which were needed for the functioning of such rural business. With the intention of encouraging
        people having such rural business, he established “Kuntavalli Industries Private Limited” (KIPL) and got the
        import licenses for it. Through the company, he not only imported the equipment needed for his company but also
        imported construction equipment from abroad, modified it according to the local market needs and sold to the
        needy people, thereby started the process of Trading. Responsibility of delivering the needed equipment to the
        people on-time lies on our company. Since, Vishwanath himself has technical knowledge on machines, he has made
        sure that imported machineries are defect-proof.</p>
      <p>We recently established “Ibbani food industries” (IFI) with the objective of reaching out Malenadu food
        varieties which has demand across the state for its purity. Several tasty recipes prepared using vegetables and
        fruits grown through organic farming are introduced into the market with the name “Malenadu Ibbani”.

        With the purpose of reducing the pollution and its ill effects on human health, investing all his education
        experience into the advantage, we have taken a stride ahead and have established a public limited company called
        “V-Tech Auto Motors Limited” which manufactures pollution free, battery-driven vehicles. In the first stage of
        it, two wheelers have been manufactured and is in the phase of getting green signal from vehicle department of
        Government for the sale.</p>
