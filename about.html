          <p>V-Tech Engineers which is proud company of Malenadu and Karnataka state hails from Kuntavalli village which comes under Melige gram panchayat of Thirthahalli taluk of Shivamogga district, the district popularly known as Cradle of Malenadu.

          <h2 style="color: rgb(27, 27, 136);">The Glorious Journey From The Roots</h3>
          <p>In the region of malenadu, Farmers found their livelihood in the Arecanut crop. But as the years passed, the problems slowly started growing up and farmers who are completely depending on the crop got more bitter than sweet. At first, the problems faced by small and medium scale landowners/farmers was scarcity of labours for processing of Arecanut. Also adding to their woes was the fluctuation in the rates of Arecanut. These all slowly resulted in giving up mindset of farmers, since there was no appropriate rate for the crop grown. Young people who were witnessing this, started moving towards cities, from villages. This increased complications in the homes of the cultivators.

          </p>

      <div>
          <p> K. Vishwanath, who predominantly hails from agriculture family, carefully observed all these predicaments, he was determined to find full stop for the same and started working towards Arecanut dehusking machine right from the days of his studies in the year 2001-02. He received lot of criticism, obstacles in the initial stages of innovation. He was so tenacious that he didn’t look at anything other than his main motto of helping the farmers to overcome their problems. He worked round the clock to achieve his goal, visited cultivator’s home often to finetune his creation and finally delivered Arecanut dehusking machine which is of great quality and beneficial to farmers.</p>
          <p>Vishwanath, who had his interests in various domains, found purity of water of river Tunga [as said in puranas, Ganga snana, Tunga paana] is sky-high and with the intention of spreading the taste of the water across the country, established “Ibbani” which is pure water supplying Industry. It has its own fame and demand, popular across the state.</p>
          <p>V-Tech Engineers company, which got Accreditation from government of India in the year 2007, haven’t restricted themselves to Arecanut dehusking machine, but have spread their horizons by successfully inventing Arecanut bunch separator, Gorabalu polisher, Pepper separating machines and several more farmer-friendly and farmer-centric products.

              Numerous people have started their own business in the rural regions. For those kinds of people, getting imported equipment was only through some import companies in the big cities. Vishwanath, who will be travelling to foreign countries to buy the basic machineries for his company, scrutinized the circumstances and brought in the machineries which were needed for the functioning of such rural business. With the intention of encouraging people having such rural business, he established “Kuntavalli Industries Private Limited” (KIPL) and got the import licenses for it. Through the company, he not only imported the equipment needed for his company but also imported construction equipment from abroad, modified it according to the local market needs and sold to the needy people, thereby started the process of Trading. Responsibility of delivering the needed equipment to the people on-time lies on our company. Since, Vishwanath himself has technical knowledge on machines, he has made sure that imported machineries are defect-proof.</p>
          <p>We recently established “Ibbani food industries” (IFI) with the objective of reaching out Malenadu food varieties which has demand across the state for its purity. Several tasty recipes prepared using vegetables and fruits grown through organic farming are introduced into the market with the name “Malenadu Ibbani”.

              With the purpose of reducing the pollution and its ill effects on human health, investing all his education experience into the advantage, we have taken a stride ahead and have established a public limited company called “V-Tech Auto Motors Limited” which manufactures pollution free, battery-driven vehicles. In the first stage of it, two wheelers have been manufactured and is in the phase of getting green signal from vehicle department of Government for the sale.</p>
